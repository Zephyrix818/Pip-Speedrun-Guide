<h3>What is Pip?</h3>
<p>Pip is a platforming game created on the PICO-8 cartridge by rarelikeaunicorn. 
PICO-8 is a platform for console games that run on Windows. Pip can be played <a 
href="https://rarelikeaunicorn.itch.io/pip" target="blank">here</a>, and you can check out 
rarelikeaunicorn's itch.io page <a href="https://rarelikeaunicorn.itch.io/" target="blank">
here</a>.</p>
<h3>How do you play Pip?</h3>
<p>After clicking the first link above, you will be greeted by a PICO-8 loading screen.
After waiting for a bit you will be greeted with a menu screen. Use arrow keys to move
the selection cursor, z or x to select, and [enter] to enter the pause menu. Once you get
comfortable with the controls, select 'Arcade Mode'. After a short cutscene where the 
falls from the nest, you will be in the game. Use arrow keys to move left and right, z to 
make a large jump, and x to make a short hop. The aim of the game is to collect feathers, 
and reach your nest, which is located high above. For each feather collected, you will 
one more jump, which can be performed in the air by pressing z. Some other controls 
including diving, which increases the speed that you fall, and can be activated by 
pressing x. A dive can be cancelled mid-air by pressing z, and this is called a 
dive-cancel. This move also uses one of your charges for jumping.</p>
